#+TITLE: My dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Matthias Paulmier

These are my dotfiles. A lot of them have been stolen other people's
config (I'll try to give proper credit wherever I can). These files are
intended for my usage only and it may not fit your likings. I don't give
that much time to my config files so they may lack a lot of things that
are important to most users.

properly:

It will configure the following programs:
